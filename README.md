## MyEducation
I created this using R Markdown and leaflet to show the places, I studied and worked. I created different categories of icons to classify the profiles. I represent the education with a “gradute” icon and different icons reflecting my research of interest. For example, in Hungary my research was on “Mushrooms” and “Sea anemones” in Saudi Arabia.
